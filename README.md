## What is Feature Engineering ?
- Feature Engineering is the process of selecting, creating or modifying features like input variables or data to help machine learning models learn patterns more effectively.
- It involves transforming raw data into meaningful inputs that improve model accuracy and performance.
- Feature engineering preprocesses raw data into a machine-readable format.
- It optimizes ML model performance by transforming and selecting relevant features.

## Importance of Feature Engineering
- Improve accuracy: Choosing the right features helps the model learn better, leading to more accurate predictions.
- Reduce overfitting: Using fewer, more important features helps the model avoid memorizing the data and perform better on new data.
- Boost interpretability: Well-chosen features make it easier to understand how the model makes its predictions.
- Enhance efficiency: Focusing on key features speeds up the model’s training and prediction process, saving time and resources.
